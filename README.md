This extension enables viewing your news & social media posts regarding Jews as if they are about Jews (circa 1940's), so you can answer DISLaFN?


Inspired by this protest sign.  Individual in pic is unknown for attribution.

I recommend pairing this source code with "Weight of the World" by Apoptygma Berzerk  -  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OilB45L-5kA)
